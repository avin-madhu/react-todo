# react-todo

### Basic Details

* react has a something called functional components that return a "react fragment"

* react fragment is enclosed within "<> </>"

* It can return a div containing javascript, it's called JSX and it helps a lot since if we're not using react we had to write js somewhere else and bind it to the the div.

* rfc --> stands for react functional Component ( we can simply create a react function component using this short keyword)

### Run

command: ```npm run dev```

### props

* props are property of a tag it can be destructures as :
```consr {children} = props```

### State

* useState() --> used to make stateful varibales, we can interact with these it should have a variable name and also a setter function so it is defined as: 

const [num, setNum] = useState()

It listens for any change in the document and the page will be repainted matching the current update.
